# automate-code-review

`added danger for checking commits compliance `

```
Danger is an extensible automated checker for merge requests. The rules are defined locally by code: it can inspect the current MR changes and perform any action based on whatever criteria you define. Start using Danger here to automatically apply labels based on the files which have been changed.

Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of the kinds of things Danger has been used for at GitLab so far:

- Coding style
- Database review
- Documentation review
- Merge request metrics
- Reviewer roulette
- Single codebase effort

### How To

- [Gitlab Templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml)
- [Danger Github Action](https://github.com/MeilCli/danger-action)
- [Gitlab Node API](https://github.com/jdalrymple/gitbeaker)

```
If you no longer need a global secondary index, you can delete it using the UpdateTable operation. You can delete only one global secondary index per UpdateTable operation. While the global secondary index is being deleted, there is no effect on any read or write activity in the parent table.
```
